The system classes are a comma-separated list of patterns that indicate whether to load a class from the system classpath, instead from the user-supplied JARs, when mapreduce.job.classloader is enabled. A positive pattern is defined as: 1. A single class name 'C' that matches 'C' and transitively all nested classes 'C$*' defined in C; 2. A package name ending with a '.' (e.g., ""com.example."") that matches all classes from that package. A negative pattern is defined by a '-' in front of a positive pattern (e.g., ""-com.example.""). A class is considered a system class if and only if it matches one of the positive patterns and none of the negative ones. More formally: A class is a member of the inclusion set I if it matches one of the positive patterns. A class is a member of the exclusion set E if it matches one of the negative patterns.
